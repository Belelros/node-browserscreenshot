# browserscreenshot

browserscreenshot uses the BrowserStack's Screenshot API to take screenshots from websites and downloads to your computer.
It's great for automated tests to get a glance of your site in different browsers.

Note that this feature needs as of now, a "Regular" BrowserStack plan. Please, see [BrowserStack](http://www.browserstack.com/screenshots/pricing) for more details.
